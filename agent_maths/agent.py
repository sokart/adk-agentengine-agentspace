  """Calculates the sum of a list of integers.

    This function takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all
    the elements in the list.  It uses the built-in `sum()` function for
    efficiency.

    Args:
        numbers: A list of integers to be added.

    Returns:
        The sum of the integers in the input list.  Returns 0 if the input
        list is empty.

    Examples:
        add([1, 2, 3]) == 6

    This function performs subtraction on a list of integers, applying the

    Args:

                           is zero, a ZeroDivisionError is raised.  Division by
